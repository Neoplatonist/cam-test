led = False

# 1. Using the led variable above create a function called "led_state" that writes
#   to the console whether the LED is "ON" or "OFF" in a human readable way.


# 2. Using the led variable above write a function named "toggle_led" that toggles the led.
#       If the state is OFF turn it ON and if the state is ON it turns OFF.


# 3. Using the two functions you created, "led_state" and "toggle_led",
#   print the initial led state and
#   with a while loop do the following 5 times:
#       - toggle the led
#       - print the new led state

# ( HINT: The led status should only be printed 6 times in total.
#           It starts OFF and ends being ON. )
